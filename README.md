# Password Cracker - Brute Force 4-Digit PIN Cracker

This is a web-based brute-force password cracker designed to simulate the process of cracking a 4-digit PIN. The application uses a brute-force attack to try every possible combination (0000 to 9999) to match the user-inputted password.

**Note**: This project is for educational purposes only. It aims to demonstrate how brute force attacks work in a safe, controlled, and ethical manner. It is not intended to be used for any malicious or illegal activities.
